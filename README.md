<h2>Use Case:</h2>
When downloading an asset pack from the Unity Asset Store I move it out of my Unity project and into a seperate local library of assets on my PC. I do this to only import files into my games that are required and to make browsing and reuse of assets easier.
</br> </br>
However, Unity creates a .meta file for each folder and file in your Unity project which makes browsing the moved files in a file explorer miserable and requires a lot of clean up. This script will find and purge all .meta files in your local asset library to make browsing in a file explorer much more pleasent. </br>

<h2>Compatability:</h2>
- Windows only </br>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
- Download Source Code (Zip) from latest <a href="https://github.com/Fenris42/Delete_Meta_Files/releases">Release</a> </br>
- Extract and place Delete_Meta.ps1 file in root of your local asset library directory </br>
- Right click Delete_Meta.ps1 - > Run with Powershell </br>
